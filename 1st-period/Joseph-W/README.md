## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Joseph Wisely, a junior in high school with a growing passion for computer science and web development. I started my journey with C++, which gave me a strong foundation in programming logic. Over the past year, I’ve expanded into frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building interactive web projects and continually pushing myself to learn new skills as I grow as a developer.

## 📚 Project Overview

This portfolio project is the culmination of everything I’ve learned in computer science this school year. It features a collection of my favorite web-based projects, built using core web technologies. Throughout the process, I gained hands-on experience with responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and structuring clean, readable code. Each project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and taught me how to bring creative ideas to life on the web.

## 🖥️ What's in My Portfolio?

My portfolio website acts as a central hub for showcasing my best work. It includes:

- An "About Me" section introducing who I am and what I’ve learned  
- Project descriptions and visuals for each featured project  
- Links to live versions of each project for visitors to explore  

## 🚀 Featured Projects

🏀 **Flappy Ball**  
A fun twist on the classic Flappy Bird game — this version features a bouncing ball navigating through pipes. Built with JavaScript, the game includes gravity, collision detection, and keyboard controls to challenge the player’s timing and reflexes.

🏆 **Cup Pong**  
This is a simple web-based version of the classic cup pong game. Players aim and shoot a virtual ball to land in cups. The project allowed me to experiment with angle mechanics, shooting strength, and user interaction through mouse input.

🥠 **Fortune Cookie Generator**  
A lighthearted app that displays a random fortune each time a user "cracks" the cookie. I used arrays and randomization in JavaScript to make every interaction unique. It’s a fun way to practice core JavaScript skills in a creative project.
