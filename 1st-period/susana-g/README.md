# Final Portfolio Project – Susana G.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Susana G., a high school junior and aspiring developer. I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life. My goal is to continue growing as a programmer by working on challenging projects, collaborating with others, and expanding my knowledge.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project is the culmination of my work throughout the year. It showcases my progress as a developer and reflects both the technical and creative skills I've developed. Throughout this journey, I’ve gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control using Git. I also learned the importance of user-centered design and how to present my work in a clear and engaging way.

## What's Included

My portfolio site includes the following sections:

* **About Me:** A brief introduction to who I am and what drives me as a developer.
* **Projects:** A curated selection of my best work, each with a short description.
* **Responsive Design:** Built to look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
