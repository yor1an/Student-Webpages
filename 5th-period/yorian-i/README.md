## About Me

Hello, my name is Yorian Ixcol. I am a new programmer, and this year I discovered the complexities that come with being a coder. I am a patient coder and a very outgoing one. When I have questions, I try my best to ask. I try to recognize the fact that I'm no expert, but also don't let that completely define me. I like to learn. This is why I consider myself a very beginner-level developer. This only pushes me to continue pursuing technological knowledge and trying to master coding.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project represents my learning journey throughout the year. I explored the complexities of coding and gained a better appreciation for developers' skills. I learned the basics of computers, including binary code and C++, and was introduced to web development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designing with these languages quickly became one of my favorite things to do. Although it sometimes required time that was hard to find, I always found the process enjoyable.

This project showcases what I’ve learned in computer science this year. I built simple games using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learned how to structure a website, write interactive code, and solve problems like a developer. It was a fun and challenging way to apply everything I’ve learned. This class impacted me in a beyond academic way, as it also taught me to face unexpected challenges of life, and to persist. 

## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio site includes the following projects, each showcasing my growing skills in programming and game development:

- **Tic Tac Toe:** A classic two-player game played on a 3×3 grid where players take turns marking Xs and Os. The goal is to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

- **Memory Card Game:** A card matching game where players flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

- **Connect Four:** A strategic two-player game where players take turns dropping colored coins into a 7-column grid. The first player to connect four coins in a row wins.
